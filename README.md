   - Working with Dataframes and Series to store and manipulate data.

3. Indexes in Pandas: 
   - Understanding the concept of indexes in Pandas.
   - Utilizing different types of indexes for efficient data access.

4. Conditional Filtering in Pandas: 
   - Filtering and querying data based on specified conditions.
   - Applying logical operators and methods for conditional filtering.

5. Update Rows and Columns in Pandas: 
   - Modifying and updating data in Pandas Dataframes.
   - Techniques for altering individual rows and columns.

6. Add/Remove Columns of Data: 
   - Adding new columns to existing Dataframes.
   - Removing unnecessary columns from Dataframes.

7. Master Data Sorting in Pandas: 
   - Sorting Dataframes based on specific criteria.
   - Applying multiple sorting keys for advanced sorting operations.

8. Clean & Save DataFrames: 
   - Techniques for cleaning and preprocessing data.
   - Saving cleaned Dataframes to various file formats.
